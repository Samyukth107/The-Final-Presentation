# Synthetic Identity Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting synthetic identity fraud using machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost. It includes EDA, statistical validation, model training, evaluation, and fraud loss estimation.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `notebook/` – Contains the Jupyter notebook (`synthetic_fraud_detection.ipynb`)
- `data/` – Placeholder for dataset files (not uploaded here due to size)
- `images/` – Visual outputs like confusion matrices and EDA plots
- `project_draft.pdf` – Full project documentation and A3 analysis

## 🚀 Key Features
